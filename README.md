# Lighted
 A small script to get images sources from [Lightshot](https://prnt.sc)
# How it works
 The script generates a random 6 character string (like "oaiduf"), makes a request to prnt.sc, gets the "no-click screenshot-image" source and prints it to the console, together with the status code of the request.
